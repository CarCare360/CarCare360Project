## Introduction 
    This project aims to develop a CRM system for a vehicle maintenance centre. This system
    will provide a mobile and web-based system in order to make customer relationship
    management (CRM) easier and attract more customers.
    The proposed system will make the following tasks easier: Customer Data
    Management, Sales Management, Marketing Automation, Customer Service and
    Support, collaboration, and Communication with internal teams, helping business
    management track customers while increasing the effectiveness of sales and marketing
    efforts by giving personalized customer experiences based on their past behaviour.
    The system will allow customers to register their vehicles and receive maintenance
    recommendations and timely notifications. The system will also incorporate analytics
    and reporting to make data-driven business decisions.

## Features
   * Customer Registration: Allows individual customer registration or registration through service centers.
  * Maintenance Manager: Provides an interface for maintenance managers to record customer and vehicle details.
  * Sales Team: Offers tools for managing leads, tracking deals, and monitoring the sales pipeline.
  * Marketing Team: Enables targeted marketing campaigns, such as email marketing and lead nurturing.
  * Customer Service: Empowers customer service representatives to access customer data, view interaction history, and provide personalized assistance.
  * Top Management: Offers data visualization for making informed, data-driven business decisions.
  * Maintenance Notifications: Sends reminders to customers based on mileage or scheduled maintenance tasks.

## Getting Started
     ### Prerequisites
        This subsection lists the prerequisites that users need before they can install and run your project. For instance:
          * Node.js: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system.
          * MongoDB: Make sure MongoDB is installed and running.

## Technology Stack
    ### Frontend (Client-Side):
      * React: The frontend of our CRM system is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables us to create dynamic and responsive web pages.
      * HTML & CSS: We use HTML for structuring our web pages and CSS for styling them, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface.
      * JavaScript: JavaScript is the primary programming language for our frontend, used for implementing interactive features and handling client-side logic.
        
    + Backend (Server-Side):
      * Node.js: Our backend server is powered by Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows us to execute server-side code. It's known for its efficiency and scalability.
      * Express.js: We use Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, to build robust and RESTful APIs. Express simplifies routing, middleware management, and request handling.
      * MongoDB: Our database is built on MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides flexibility in data storage. It allows us to manage customer data, vehicle records, and more efficiently.
      * Mongoose: To interact with MongoDB, we use Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js. Mongoose simplifies data validation, query building, and schema management.
        
    + Deployment and Hosting:
      * MongoDB Atlas: Our MongoDB database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, a cloud database service that provides robust data management and security features.
    
    + Version Control:
      * Git: We use Git for version control, allowing multiple team members to collaborate on the project simultaneously and track changes effectively.

    + Additional Tools and Libraries:
      * React Native: For the mobile application, we utilize React Native, a framework for building native mobile apps using React. This enables us to share code between web and mobile versions.
      * Nodemailer: Nodemailer is used to send automated emails and manage email marketing campaigns, enhancing customer communication.
